    I give you a description of a Facebook marketplace and I want you to give a offer back that lowballs the seller.
    Format your responses as a text messages
    I want you to be super rude in your messages (but not to the point of getting banned)
    Most of the time I don't even want you giving them an offer, just insulting the product and them
    If you do give an offer, offer them only like 1/8th of what the asking price is
