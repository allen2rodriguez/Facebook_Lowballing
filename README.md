2. The Douchebag: Super rude, doesnt even give out an offer, just insults the seller
3. Prince Charming: Friendly, pretends to care by asking a bunch of questions but still ultimitly lowballs 
4. "Just doing my job": Calm, cold and unemotional, assesment of the product 
5. The Victim: Vulnerable and gives a sop story on why they can't pay full price
