# Facebook Lowballing 
*Description*: Everyone loves a good Facebook marketplace scrolling every once in a while, but sometimes these pesky sellers think their junk is worth way more than it really is. So that's where this program comes in. Use these bots to handle all the dirty work by chiping away at them with lowball after lowball so that hopefully by the time you want to make your real offer, they are more willing to negotiate. Or who knows maybe they just might accept, one of these bots stupid offers.

2. **The Douchebag**: Super rude, doesnt even give out an offer, just insults the seller
3. **Prince Charming**: Friendly, pretends to care by asking a bunch of questions but still ultimitly lowballs 
4. **"Just doing my job"**: Calm, cold and unemotional, assesment of the product 
5. **The Victim**: Vulnerable and gives a sop story on why they can't pay full price
